index_desctime=This form is for changing the system's current time, which is used by all running processes. On operating systems that have a separate hardware clock, it can be used to set that too.
index_desczone=This form allows you to set the system's default time zone, which is used to convert the system time to a human-readable format and offset.
index_descsync=This form is for configuring the system to automatically synchronize the time with a remote server. Synchronization will be done using the Unix <tt>time</tt> protocol or NTP, depending on which commands are installed and what the remote system supports.
